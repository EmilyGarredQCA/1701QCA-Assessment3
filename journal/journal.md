### Related project 1 ###   
Night Light Assisstant

  https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/gabriele_fugazzi/night-light-assistant-0d9bf0?ref=tag&ref_id=motion%20sensor&offset=4
  
![Image](NightLight.jpeg)

This project is related to mine because it uses the input of a PIR Motion Detector to turn on lights to assist at night.  This function is the same principal to my original concepts however in my final project this was reversed with the lights coming on when there is no movement.


### Related project 2 ###   
Magical Mushrom Lights

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5LjGFkpApw

![Image](MagicMushrooms.JPG)

This project is related to mine because it uses LEDs to make fake mushrooms glow.  I like the way he created the realistic looking mushrooms and hope to use a similar process to make the mushrooms for my project.  However in my environment the mushrooms will be controlled by the input of the motion detector.


### Related project 3 ###   
Jelly Swarm

https://www.tangibleinteraction.com/artworks/jelly-swarm

![Image](JellySwarm.jpg)

This project is related to mine because it takes the idea of real world creatures and brings them to a state where we can learn about them by showing how the interaction of people can effect them in the wild.  This same idea is demonstrated in my project as it takes the real life reactions of wild life to an unknown presence.  The paper jellyfish were lit by LEDs which change colour and react with eachother when undisturbed but react differently when effected by humans via a sensor.


### Related project 4 ###   
People Create Space and Time, at the Confluence of their Spacetime New Space and Time is Born

https://www.teamlab.art/w/people_create_space/

![Image](PeopleCreateSpace.jpg)

This project is related to mine because it uses the same principal of stillness.  In this light display when a person remains still the projection creates a very slow ripple effect which radiates from them across the room creating a peacfull 
experience.  My project also used this continued stillness to have an effect on the environment with the project only coming to life when there is no motion.

### Related project 5 ###   
Play With Fire Over WIFI

https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/electropeak/play-with-fire-over-wi-fi-esp8266-neopixels-android-app-26c4ad?ref=tag&ref_id=led%20strip&offset=5

![Image](Fire.JPG)

This project is related to mine because the effect demonstrated to create the fire uses a NeoPixel LED strip.  I got the idea of including a running water effect from this project as when the light turns blue it reminded me of water. 


### Related project 6 ###   
Flutter of Butterflies Beyond Borders, Ephemeral Life Born from People

https://www.teamlab.art/w/butterflies_ephemerallife_people/

![Image](FlutterOfButterflies.jpg)

This project is related to mine because when a person stands still it allows for projections of butterflies to grow on them before flying away and navigating the space on their own.  This takes the same idea with the stillness and adds life to it albeit in a non-material form and replicates my idea of stillness welcoming life.





## Other research ##
<!--- Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it. You should include a reference or link to each of these resources. --->

#### Micro:bit Lesson 3. NeoPixels with Micro:bit ####

https://learn.adafruit.com/micro-bit-lesson-3-neopixels-with-micro-bit/software

This website gave me a good understanding of the basics of programing a NeoPixel with a Microbit to get the desired effect to make the LED strip appear as flowing water.  I was able to experiment with different colour, brightness and movement of the lights.

#### LED Strip Effects ####

https://www.tweaking4all.com/hardware/arduino/adruino-led-strip-effects/

This website gave me lots of examples of what could be done with the NeoPixel strip and what effect could make the best running water however the programing was made for Arduino and couldn't be used with the Microbit.  The videos also showed how to give a more diffused and glowing effect by placing a thin material like tissue just above the lights. 


#### Connecting a PIR motion sensor to a Micro:bit ####

https://www.teachwithict.com/pir.html

This basic tutorial on how to connect the Microbit to the PIR motion detector gave me a simple code however had very unreliable results.  I found that even when the sensor was totaly covered the indicator light on the Microbit continued to switch between the two inputs.


#### How PIR modules work and using them to control LED strings. ####

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evZM2_RTvTU

This indepth video tutorial gave me extensive information on how the PIR motion detector works, how to adjust different components to get better results and how to make a basic circuit using LEDs.  This helped solve the problems experienced from the previous website.


#### Microbit + Spotify ####

https://www.hackster.io/samelhusseini/microbit-spotify-windows-8a8551

I had an idea to also connect the Microbit to play forest sound effects along with the other components to add another layer of realism to the environment.  This tutorial gave detailed instructions and seemed effective however it would have needed two Microbits, plus another program that would allow the Microbit to communicate with the computer and Spotify.  This extra expense coupled with the unfamiliar program and coding required on my computer prompted me to reconsider this idea.


#### Inventors Kit Experiment 4 ####

https://www.kitronik.co.uk/blog/experiment-4-using-a-transistor-to-drive-a-motor/

I used the coding in this experiment as inspiration to give the fireflies a fluctuating glow.  This allowed me to control the LEDs making them illuminate gratually and pulse in a realistic manner. 







## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
<!--- Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence. --->

### Design ideation ###
<!--- Document your ideation process. This will include the design concepts presented for assessment 2. You can copy and paste that information here. --->

### Final design concept ###
<!--- This should be a description of your concept including its context, motivation, or other relevant information you used to decide on this concept. --->

### Interaction flowchart ###
<!--- Include an interaction flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible. --->

## Process documentation ##
<!--- In this section, include text and images (and potentially links to video) that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.

This should have quite a lot of information! It will likely include most of the process documentation from assessment 2 which can be copied and pasted here.

Use subheadings to structure this code. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for details of how to insert subheadings.

There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. --->

## Final code ##

<!--- Include here screenshots of the final code you used in the project if it is done with block coding. If you have used javascript, micropython, C, or other code, include it as text formatted as code using a series of three backticks ` before and after the code block. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for more information about that formatting. --->


## Design process discussion ##
<!--- Discuss your process used in this project, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process. --->


## Reflection ##

<!--- Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.

What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?

What parts of your project do you feel are novel. This is IMPORTANT to help justify a key component of the assessment rubric.

What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used? --->
